# Kanban Feature Documentation

## Overview

The Kanban feature in the task manager application facilitates organizing tasks into columns for better visualization and management. This documentation provides an overview of the key components, including data sources, repositories, use cases, and presentation logic.

## Components

### Data Sources

1. **Remote Data Sources**
   - **ColumnRemoteDataSource**: Responsible for fetching and creating columns remotely via API calls.
   - **CommentRemoteDataSource**: Handles remote operations related to comments on tasks, such as fetching, creating, updating, and deleting comments.
   - **ProjectRemoteDataSource**: Manages remote operations for projects, including fetching and creating projects.
   - **TaskRemoteDataSource**: Handles remote CRUD operations for tasks, including fetching, creating, updating, and deleting tasks.

2. **Local Data Sources**
   - **TaskLocalDataSource**: Handles local storage operations for tasks, including caching tasks locally.
   - **TaskLogLocalDataSource**: Manages local storage of task log histories.

### Repositories

1. **Repositories**
   - **ColumnRepositoryImpl**: Implements the ColumnRepository interface, handling business logic related to columns.
   - **CommentRepositoryImpl**: Implements the CommentRepository interface, managing operations related to comments.
   - **ProjectRepositoryImpl**: Implements the ProjectRepository interface, handling project-related operations.
   - **TaskLogRepositoryImp**: Implements the TaskLogRepository interface, managing task log histories.
   - **TaskRepositoryImpl**: Implements the TaskRepository interface, handling tasks-related operations.

### Use Cases

1. **Column Use Cases**
   - **CreateColumnUsecase**: Handles the creation of columns.
   - **GetColumnsUsecase**: Retrieves columns for display.

2. **Comment Use Cases**
   - **CreateCommentUsecase**: Handles the creation of comments on tasks.
   - **DeleteCommentUsecase**: Manages the deletion of comments.
   - **GetCommentsUsecase**: Retrieves comments for display.
   - **UpdateCommentUsecase**: Manages updating comments.

3. **Project Use Cases**

   - **GetProjectUsecase**: Retrieves project details.
   - **GetProjectsUsecase**: Retrieves projects for display.

4. **Task Log Use Cases**
   - **GetTasksLogsUescas**: Retrieves task log histories.
   - **NewTaskLogUsecase**: Manages the creation of task log entries.

5. **Task Use Cases**
   - **CreateTaskUsecase**: Handles the creation of tasks.
   - **DeleteTaskUsecase**: Manages the deletion of tasks.
   - **GetTaskUsecase**: Retrieves task details.
   - **GetTasksUsecase**: Retrieves tasks for display.
   - **UpdateTaskUsecase**: Manages updating tasks.

### Presentation Logic

1. **Cubits**
   - **ColumnCubit**: Manages state related to columns.
   - **CommentCubit**: Manages state related to comments.
   - **NotificationCubit**: Handles state related to notifications.
   - **ProjectCubit**: Manages state related to projects.
   - **TaskCubit**: Handles state related to tasks.
   - **ThemeCubit**: Manages state related to app themes.
   - **TimerCubit**: Handles state related to timers.
Sure, here's an extension to the documentation covering the presentation layer, screens, and widgets:

## Presentation Layer

The presentation layer of the Kanban feature encompasses screens, widgets, and state management using Cubits. This layer is responsible for rendering user interfaces, handling user interactions, and managing application state.

### Screens

1. **Welcome Screen**: The initial screen that users see upon opening the app, providing a brief introduction or sign-in options.
2. **Home Screen**: Serves as the central hub of the application, offering navigation to various sections such as projects, notifications, settings, etc.
3. **Project Screen**: Displays a list of projects and allows users to create new projects.
4. **Column Screen**: Renders a Kanban board with columns representing different stages of task progression.
5. **Task Screen**: Shows details of individual tasks and allows users to create, update, and delete tasks.
6. **Notification Screen**: Displays notifications or alerts related to tasks, projects, or other activities within the app.
7. **Settings Screen**: Allows users to customize app preferences, manage account settings, and adjust other configuration options.
8. **Create Column Screen**: Offers functionality to create a new column within a Kanban board, specifying its name, position, and other attributes.
9. **Create Project Screen**: Provides a form or interface for users to create a new project, including details such as name, description, members, etc.
10. **Task History Screen**: Shows a log or history of activities related to tasks, such as creation, updates, assignments, comments, etc.
11. **View and Update Task Screen**: Allows users to view detailed information about a specific task and perform actions such as editing task details, marking as completed, assigning to users, etc.

### Widgets

1. **Project Widget**: Represents a project card with project details and options for editing and deleting.
2. **Column Widget**: Renders a column in the Kanban board, displaying tasks within that column.
3. **Task Widget**: Represents a task card within a column, showing task details and options for editing and deleting.
4. **Comment Widget**: Displays a comment within the task details screen, allowing users to view, edit, or delete comments.
5. **Notification Widget**: Displays notifications for task reminders or updates.
5. **Task Card**: Represents a task card with project details 
5. **Draggable Task Card**: Represents a draggable task card with project details 
5. **Color Picker Dialog**:  Provides options for picking a color
6. **Theme Switch Widget**: Provides options for switching between light and dark themes.

## Conclusion

The Kanban feature's architecture includes well-structured components, separating concerns for data handling, business logic, and presentation. This modular design enhances maintainability, scalability, and testability of the application.
